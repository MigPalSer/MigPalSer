### Hey ðŸ‘‹

My name is Miguel, I am from Spain and born in 1992.

I studied material engineering but, after realizing I don't like that career, I've taken the path to become a software engineer.

I'm currently, since 2020, learning Java and its frameworks which is, actually, my main technology. I, also, write in python.

Actually working as a software engineer, creating microservices with java spring boot.
