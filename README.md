### Hey ðŸ‘‹

My name is Miguel, I am from Spain and born in 1992.

I studied material engineering but, after realizing I don't like that career, I've taken the path to become a software engineer.

Actually working at GFT with automation, DevOps, QA and testing. 

You can see my open CV [here](https://migpalser.github.io/mycv/)), and write to me at migpalser@protonmail.ch.

Some quick facts about me:

Dislike: social media, news, resentful people, cities, school system, visual basic 6, fake things (caffeine-free coffee, alcohol-free beer, vegetable "meat" and similar aberrations), cronies...
